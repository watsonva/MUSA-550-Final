# 3. UI Design


## 3.1 Current User Interface

Airbnb’s existing filter system is complex and underused. Furthermore, it lacks a clear price reference, making it challenging for users to assess room options effectively.


## 3.2 Our Solution

Our solution enhances the Airbnb experience. Users typically follow a simple process: log in, search, and decide. Trrendy, as an Airbnb plugin, adds two crucial steps: input information into our tool and compare prices. This approach ensures more informed decisions.



## 3.3 Future User Interface

We propose adding an input window to Airbnb’s interface, allowing users to specify criteria like mood, budget, and location. This feature aims to replace the less efficient existing filter system.

Our interface will also display suggested prices next to Airbnb's listings, using red and green color codes. Red indicates a price higher than our suggestion, with the intensity indicating the premium. Green suggests a lower price, offering potential savings.

Moreover, Trrendy will also provide direct recommendations on whether a listed price is excessively high or exceptionally low, aiding users in making better decisions.
